# Ti-Nb-O_data_for_publication
TiNbO_all_data_for_publication_1178_structures.json contains all the data needed to plot the ternary 0K convex hull.

Additional data (relaxed POSCARs and OSZICARs) can be extracted from the files in the "compressed" folder.

Folders labelled casm1.2X_* are casm projects (CASMv1.2.0) where the POSCARs/OSZICARs can be found in the 'training_data' folder

All other structures can be found in the 'data_for_remaining_structures' folder. Structures greater than 50meV/atom above the convex hull were omitted to minimize the size of this dataset but a list of those additional structures and their hull distances is included. 

If you'd like additional files for any structure, please email Jonathan Li (jonathan_li@ucsb.edu) or any of the other authors.
